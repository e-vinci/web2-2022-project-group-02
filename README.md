## Usage

API is served on port `8080` (proxied on the frontend under `/api`) and the frontend on port `3000`.

To install dependencies, run `npm install` inside the `api` and `frontend` folders.

Run `npm start` inside the `api` and `frontend` folders to start the API and frontend respectively.

To build the frontend, run `npm run build` inside the `frontend` folder. The build will be in the
`dist` folder.

## API

The API is a REST API. The endpoints with ðŸ”’ require authentication.
